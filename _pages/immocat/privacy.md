# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted in Immocat for iPhone, Mac, iPad, and any other devices and platforms.

I strongly believe that your data belongs to you. I do not collect any identifiable information about you and only track the bare minimum needed to debug issues and to view download and purchase trends.

Immocat collects anonymised metadata using Apple’s built in metrics system. This system sends data such as session length, crash reports, device type, and locale.

Apple's privacy policy can be found [here](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

Anonymised crash reports and device info are used to fix crashes within the app. Total download count and other aggregated metrics may be used for marketing purposes.

By using Immocat, you consent to this privacy policy.

Changes to this privacy policy may periodically be made and posted here. Visit this page at any time to check for updates.
